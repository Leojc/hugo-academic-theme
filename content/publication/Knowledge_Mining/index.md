abstract: "Recently, the semantics of scene text has been proven to be essential
  in fine-grained image classification. However, the existing methods mainly
  exploit the literal meaning of scene text for fine-grained recognition, which
  might be irrelevant when it is not significantly related to objects/scenes. We
  propose an end-to-end trainable network that mines implicit contextual
  knowledge behind scene text image and enhance the semantics and correlation to
  fine-tune the image representation. Unlike the existing methods, our model
  integrates three modalities: visual feature extraction, text semantics
  extraction, and correlating background knowledge to fine-grained image
  classification. Specifically, we employ KnowBert to retrieve relevant
  knowledge for semantic representation and combine it with image features for
  fine-grained classification. Experiments on two benchmark datasets, Con-Text,
  and Drink Bottle, show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art by
  3.72% mAP and 5.39% mAP, respectively. To further validate the effectiveness
  of the proposed method, we create a new dataset on crowd activity recognition
  for the evaluation. The source code, new dataset, and pre-trained models of
  this work will be publicly available."
